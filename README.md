# Hi, I'm Joe NguyenðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring data analyst and this is a space to share my projects.

Background:
I come from an IT consulting background where I've implemented NetSuite projects for the past five years. I specialized in accounting and finance processes. I gained an interest in data when using the query functionality in NetSuite.

Technologies that I'm learning:
- SQL
- Python
- Looker
- Tableau
- PowerBI
