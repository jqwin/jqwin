Project NBA Twitter Sentiment Analysis -

NBA Twitter Scraper NLP Analysis
> This script uses snscrape to pull tweets from twitter based on a user defined search criteria
> The search criteria looked for tweets that contain the terms #wemby and is within the date range of 6/22 to 6/23
> The script then reads each tweet and gives a polarity(sentiment) rating
>   a rating can be between -1 to +1, negative to positive respectively
> In the end the script produces a flat file(python_nba_tweets_wemby.csv)

How did NBA Twitter feel about #Wemby.pptx
> Presentation visualizes the data from the flat file
